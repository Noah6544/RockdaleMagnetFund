**Second Freelance WebDev Gig**

I was hired to design, develop, and deploy the [Rockdale Magnet Fund Website](https://rockdalemagnetfund.org) website. 

This website was for my high school: Rockdale Magnet School For Science and Technology

This site was my first Tailwindcss project. 
Stack:
- Tailwind
- HTML
- JS

If you're seeing this readme, it's because the site is now live and I can release the source code as I've been paid lol.

If you are interested in hiring me for your next website, please contact me @Buchanan Noah 100 at gmail dot com
